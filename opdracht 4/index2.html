        Joseph Dacre Carlyle (Carlisle, June 4, 1758 - Newcastle upon Tyne,
        April 12, 1804) is an English orientalist who, after studying at
        Cambridge University, became a professor of Arabic. In 1799, he was
        attached by the British government to Lord Elgin's embassy in the
        Ottoman Empire. He was in charge of exploring the region's libraries
        (mainly the SÃ©rail library) to discover (and acquire) unpublished
        manuscripts of ancient texts. He also went to Egypt, the Holy Land and
        Mount Athos. His mission was, from his point of view, a failure. He
        bought a few hundred books, mainly in the bazaars of Constantinople, but
        none of them contained any unpublished text. However, the manner in
        which some manuscripts had been acquired, mainly those of the Patriarch
        of Jerusalem Anthemos I, as well as the quarrel that had begun on the
        Trojan Plain between Carlyle and another Cambridge professor, Edward
        Daniel Clarke, were to be used, after Carlyle's death, against Lord
        Elgin, in the controversies surrounding the acquisition of the "Elgin
        Marbles".back in Britain in the autumn of 1801, Joseph Dacre Carlyle
        began an Arabic translation of the Bible. His death in April 1804 cut
        short this work.
