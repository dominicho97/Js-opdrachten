        Tara, originally named Antarctica and later Seamaster, is a French
        schooner designed for both exploration and environmental protection. As
        part of International Polar Year, in 2007-2008, this sailboat is being
        used in the Arctic by the Tara Arctic expedition to conduct surveys to
        better understand climate change in the Arctic. In 2009, as part of the
        Tara Oceans expedition, Tara travels the seas and oceans in a three-year
        circumnavigation to study the trapping of carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules
        by marine microorganisms such as plankton. In April 2016, a new Tara
        Pacific expedition was launched to understand coral, threatened by human
        and climatic factors1.
